Winning space race with data science

The commercial space age is here. Our company SpaceY is entering the market and defining its strategy.
One of the first steps is to determine the price of each launch.

Regular rockets have its payload enclosed in the fairings; the second stage helps bring the payload to orbit, 
but most of the work is done by the first stage which is quite large and expensive.
Actually, the rocket launch cost will depend mostly on the possibility of recovering that first stage, as demonstrated by SpaceX.
It advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars while other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each.

First stage recovering strategy will be thus adopted. However, sometimes it will not land correctly and will crash. Therefore, if we can determine
if the first stage will land, we can approximately determine the cost of a launch.

The purpose of this study is thus to build a predictive model of a rocket launch outcome.

A presentation of this study can be found in the file "09_DataScience_Capstone_v2.pdf".
The rest of files are the Jupyter Notebooks and Python files which supports the results presented in the study.
